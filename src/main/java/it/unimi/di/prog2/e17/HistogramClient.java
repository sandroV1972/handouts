   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>reads a list of positive integers from the standard input, for every integer creates a
   *       rectangle with base and height given by the integer and adds it to an histogram;
   *   <li>emits the rectangle heights in the histogram in the standard output;
   *   <li>doubles the base of the first added rectangle, and
   *   <li>emits again the rectangle heights in the histogram in the standard output.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Given the contract of {@link Histogram}, this method should always emit twice the same
   * sequence of non-increasing integers.

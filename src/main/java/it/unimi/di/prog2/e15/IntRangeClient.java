   * A method to test the {@link IntRange} class.
   *
   * <p>This methods reads the parameters of an {@link IntRange} from the lines in the standard
   * input in the form {@code command value}, where the command is:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code F} to set the from value of the range.
   *   <li>{@code T} to set the to value of the range.
   *   <li>{@code S} to set the step of the range.
   * </ul>
   *
   * commands can be repeated, the last value is the one that is considered; the default values for
   * from, to and step are respectively {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE}, {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}, and 1.
   * Once the input is exhausted, the method emits in a single line of the standard output:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>the number of integers in the range,
   *   <li>the first integer in the range (if any),
   *   <li>the last integer in the range (if different from the first).
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param args not used.
